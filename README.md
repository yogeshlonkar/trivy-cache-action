# trivy-cache-action [![Tests](https://github.com/yogeshlonkar/trivy-cache-action/actions/workflows/workflow.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yogeshlonkar/trivy-cache-action/actions/workflows/workflow.yml)

Forked from [actions/cache][actions-cache] to cache `.trivy` directory used by trivy vulnerability scanner.
The cache key is generated by fetches latest trivy db SHA256 from [ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db](https://ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db) making sure latest db is downloaded once available.

Cache directory if fixed to `.trivy` as it needs to be in `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is the directory that is mounted as a volume on [`aquasecurity/trivy-action`][trivy-action] from where trivy can use `--cache-dir` flag.
Files and folders generated by Trivy inside `.trivy` by default are owned by `root:root` instead of `runner:docker` which is default for the files generated by GitHub actions.
If ownership is not fixed in Post cache step below error is thrown

> Warning: EACCES: permission denied, scandir '/home/runner/work/\*\*\*/\*\*\*/.trivy

To resolve this, `trivy-cache-action` fixes ownership by running `chown -R $(stat . -c %u:%g) .trivy` with sudo if available.

Thanks to [@vlaurin](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-action/issues/12#issuecomment-847854159) for investigation and suggestions to make cache work with [`aquasecurity/trivy-action`][trivy-action]

## Usage

### Pre-requisites

If you are using this inside a container, a POSIX-compliant `tar` needs to be included and accessible in the execution path.

**Since [`aquasecurity/trivy-action`][trivy-action] only support linux runners this action is not tested on other platforms, it will most likely work, but you will need to make sure `.trivy` directory is passed as option to trivy command**

### Inputs

* `gh-token`: `REQUIRED` GitHub token for fetching trivy db version to determine cache key, e.g. `gh-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`
* `prefix`: Prefix for cache key in case multiple workflows concurrently push cache, e.g. `prefix: workflow1`

#### Environment Variables
* `SEGMENT_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MIN` - Segment download timeout (in minutes, default `60`) to abort download of the segment if not completed in the defined number of minutes. [Read more](#cache-segment-restore-timeout)

### Outputs

* `cache-hit` - A boolean value to indicate an exact match was found for the key

### Cache scopes

The cache is scoped to the key and branch. The default branch cache is available to other branches,
since this action uses trivy db SHA256 as a key it will restore cache if trivy db is not updated

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Caching Trivy DB

on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Trivy Cache
      uses: yogeshlonkar/trivy-cache-action@v0
      with:
        gh-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Vulnerability scan
      uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
      with:
        image-ref: my-image:v1.0.0
        exit-code: '1'
        ignore-unfixed: true
        cache-dir: .trivy
```

> Note: You must use the `trivy-cache-action` in your workflow before you run [`aquasecurity/trivy-action`][trivy-action] for the files that might be restored from the cache. If the trivy db SHA256 doesn't match an existing cache, a new cache is automatically created if the job completes successfully.

## Alternatives

This action is equivalent to running below steps with [`aquasecurity/trivy-action`][trivy-action]. You can use this instead of this action 🤷‍♂️ , might have to modify `Fix .trivy permissions` step if running inside container.

```yaml
- id: trivy-db
  name: Check trivy db sha
  env:
    GH_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
  run: |
    endpoint='/orgs/aquasecurity/packages/container/trivy-db/versions'
    headers='Accept: application/vnd.github+json'
    jqFilter='.[] | select(.metadata.container.tags[] | contains("latest")) | .name | sub("sha256:";"")'
    sha=$(gh api -H "${headers}" "${endpoint}" | jq --raw-output "${jqFilter}")
    echo "Trivy DB sha256:${sha}"
    echo "sha=${sha}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
- uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: .trivy
    key: trivy-db-${{ steps.trivy-db.outputs.sha }}
- name: Vulnerability scan
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: my-image:v1.0.0
    exit-code: '1'
    ignore-unfixed: true
    cache-dir: .trivy
- name: Fix .trivy permissions
  run: sudo chown -R $(stat . -c %u:%g) .trivy
```
